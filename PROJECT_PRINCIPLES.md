# Project Principles - Recon Agent Core

## North Star
"Build a zero-touch, secure system that transforms client data into clear exception reports, generating recurring revenue."

## Core Rules
1.  **No Manual Processing:** No invoice shall be processed via ChatGPT UI or manual email. All flows must be automated in n8n.
2.  **Security First:** Client data segregation is non-negotiable. The system is read-only to external financial systems.
3.  **Founder Time is Sacred:** Automate support, onboarding, and notifications from day one. The system must run without me.
4.  **Sell Outcomes:** We sell "AP Control & Exception Reports," not "AI."
